=head1 NAME

oar_resource_init - Generate a script for the creation of the OAR resources of a list of hosts, by connecting to each host and gathering system information.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<oar_resource_init> [options] <hostfile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hosts are read one per line from B<hostfile> (must be readable by user oar) or STDIN (if B<hostfile> is -).

Every host in B<hostfile> must have the "oar-node" service started (the command connects to the hosts via SSH on the port 6667).

The command either generates a script which could be executed afterward, or directly executes the OAR commands (oarnodesetting and oarproperty).

The following OAR resource hierarchy is assumed: 

=over

host > cpu > core

=back

Or if the B<-T> option is set:

=over

host > cpu > core > thread

=back

The mem property is set along with the hierarchy.

Other properties are not set, however the generated script can be modified to do so, or the oarnodesetting command can be used to set them afterward.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 

=item B<-H>

Handle HyperThreading. Unless B<-T> is used, every logical cpus (threads) belonging to a same core will be assigned to the cpuset internal property, separated by commas.

=item B<-T>

=item B<-o> [file]

Script filename.

=item B<-x>

Execute the script at the end and remove it.
